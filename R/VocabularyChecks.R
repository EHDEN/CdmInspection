#'
#' @param connectionDetails                An R object of type \code{connectionDetails} created using the function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the \code{DatabaseConnector} package.
#' @param cdmDatabaseSchema    	           Fully qualified name of database schema that contains OMOP CDM schema.
#'                                         On SQL Server, this should specifiy both the database and the schema, so for example, on SQL Server, 'cdm_instance.dbo'.
#' @param resultsDatabaseSchema		         Fully qualified name of database schema that we can write final results to. Default is cdmDatabaseSchema.
#'                                         On SQL Server, this should specifiy both the database and the schema, so for example, on SQL Server, 'cdm_results.dbo'.
#' @param vocabDatabaseSchema		           String name of database schema that contains OMOP Vocabulary. Default is cdmDatabaseSchema. On SQL Server, this should specifiy both the database and the schema, so for example 'results.dbo'.
#' @param oracleTempSchema                 For Oracle only: the name of the database schema where you want all temporary tables to be managed. Requires create/insert permissions to this database.
#' @param smallCellCount                   To avoid patient identifiability, cells with small counts (<= smallCellCount) are deleted. Set to NULL if you don't want any deletions.
#' @param sourceName		                   String name of the data source name. If blank, CDM_SOURCE table will be queried to try to obtain this.
#' @param sqlOnly                          Boolean to determine if Achilles should be fully executed. TRUE = just generate SQL files, don't actually run, FALSE = run Achilles
#' @param outputFolder                     Path to store logs and SQL files
#' @param verboseMode                      Boolean to determine if the console will show all execution steps. Default = TRUE
#' @return                                 An object of type \code{achillesResults} containing details for connecting to the database containing the results
#' @export
